## üåê API Endpoints

The app uses Django REST Framework's ViewSets to provide CRUD operations:

### Listings
- `GET /api/listings/`: List all properties
- `POST /api/listings/`: Create a new listing
- `GET /api/listings/{id}/`: Retrieve a specific listing
- `PUT/PATCH /api/listings/{id}/`: Update a listing
- `DELETE /api/listings/{id}/`: Remove a listing

### Bookings
- `GET /api/bookings/`: List all bookings
- `POST /api/bookings/`: Create a new booking
- `GET /api/bookings/{id}/`: Retrieve a specific booking
- `PUT/PATCH /api/bookings/{id}/`: Update a booking
- `DELETE /api/bookings/{id}/`: Cancel a booking

## üå± Data Seeding

The app includes a management command to seed the database with sample data:

```bash
python manage.py seed
```

This creates sample listings, bookings, and reviews for testing purposes.
